# phalanx

This started off as my attempt at following the Vulkan tutorial.  After I got the first triangle to render, I decided to see if I could shader recompilation to happen in my binary, and if I could get the triangle to spin.  So far, so good!

## Namesake
I named this after the Phalanx CIWS, for no particular reason.
